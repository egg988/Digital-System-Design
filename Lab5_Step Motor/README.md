A 4-phase unipolar step motor is adapted in this lab. 

**Drive modes**
In view of the operation principle of the 4-phase unipolar stepper motor，to drive the stepper drive，we have to generate 4 signals to control the 4 electromagnets. According to the different accuracy and torque，there are three modes: wave drive, full step drive and half step drive.

In this lab, we adopt **full step drive**.

**Rotation speed and direction**
- The direct of the rotation can be controlled by a switch.
- The speed of the motor can be controlled by two push buttons, one to increase the speed, and the other to decrease the speed.
- The rotation may be stopped and re-started by a push button.
